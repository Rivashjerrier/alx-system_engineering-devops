12. File type
Write a script that prints the type of the file named iamafile. The file iamafile will be in the /tmp directory when we will run your script.

Create a symbolic link to /bin/ls, named __ls__. The symbolic link should be created in the current working directory. 
14. Copy HTML files
Create a script that copies all the HTML files from the current working directory to the parent of the working directory, but only copy files that did not exist in the parent of the working directory or were newer than the versions in the parent of the working directory.

Advanced Tasks
15. Let's move
Create a script that moves all files beginning with an uppercase letter to the directory /tmp/u.

You can assume that the directory /tmp/u will exist when we will run your script

You are only allowed to use two spaces (and lines) in your script, not more.
18. Life is a series of commas, not periods
Write a command that lists all the files and directories of the current directory, separated by commas (,).

    Directory names should end with a slash (/)
    Files and directories starting with a dot (.) should be listed
    The listing should be alpha ordered, except for the directories . and .. which should be listed at the very beginning
    Only digits and letters are used to sort; Digits should come first
    You can assume that all the files we will test with will have at least one letter or one digit
    The listing should end with a new line
